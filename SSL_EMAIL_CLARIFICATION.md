# SSL & Email Clarification - Vercel vs Bluehost

## SSL Certificates

### ✅ Vercel Provides SSL (FREE & Automatic)

**Vercel includes:**
- ✅ **Automatic SSL certificates** - FREE
- ✅ **Automatic renewal** - No work needed
- ✅ **HTTPS by default** - Your site will be https://risque2.com
- ✅ **No configuration needed** - Just works

**How it works:**
- When you connect your domain to Vercel, SSL is automatically set up
- Uses Let's Encrypt (industry standard)
- Renews automatically
- No cost, no setup, no maintenance

**You DON'T need Bluehost for SSL** - Vercel handles it completely.

## Email Service

### ⚠️ Vercel Does NOT Provide Email

**Vercel is hosting only:**
- ❌ No email hosting
- ❌ No email accounts
- ❌ No email service

**You need email hosting separately.**

### ✅ Bluehost Should Still Provide Email (Even Without Website Hosting)

**Important:** Bluehost typically provides email hosting even if you're not hosting your website with them, as long as:
- Your domain is registered with them (risque2.com)
- You have an active account

**Check with Bluehost:**
- "Can I use email hosting even if I host my website elsewhere?"
- "Do I need active hosting to use email?"
- Usually the answer is YES - email is separate from website hosting

### Email Options

**Option 1: Bluehost Email (If Available)**
- ✅ Use Bluehost cPanel to create email accounts
- ✅ info@risque2.com
- ✅ admin@risque2.com
- ✅ Usually included with domain registration
- ✅ Check with Bluehost to confirm

**Option 2: Google Workspace**
- ✅ Professional email: info@risque2.com
- ✅ Cost: ~$6/month per email address
- ✅ Includes Gmail interface
- ✅ More reliable than Bluehost email

**Option 3: Microsoft 365**
- ✅ Professional email: info@risque2.com
- ✅ Cost: ~$6/month per email address
- ✅ Includes Outlook
- ✅ Good alternative

**Option 4: Zoho Mail (Free Option)**
- ✅ Free for up to 5 users
- ✅ info@risque2.com
- ✅ Basic features free
- ✅ Good for starting out

## What Bluehost Will/Won't Cancel

### They Should Keep:
- ✅ **Domain registration** - You own risque2.com
- ✅ **Email hosting** - Usually separate from website hosting
- ✅ **DNS management** - You need this to point domain to Vercel

### They Might Cancel:
- ❌ **Website hosting** - If you're not using it
- But this is fine - you're using Vercel instead

## Action Plan

### Step 1: Confirm Email with Bluehost

**Contact Bluehost and ask:**
1. "If I host my website elsewhere (Vercel), can I still use email hosting?"
2. "Do I need active website hosting to use email?"
3. "What's included with my domain registration?"

**Most likely answer:** Yes, you can still use email even if website is hosted elsewhere.

### Step 2: Set Up Email

**If Bluehost provides email:**
- Log into cPanel
- Go to "Email Accounts"
- Create: info@risque2.com
- Create: admin@risque2.com
- Set up email forwarding or use webmail

**If Bluehost doesn't provide email:**
- Use Zoho Mail (free) - https://www.zoho.com/mail
- Or Google Workspace ($6/month)
- Or Microsoft 365 ($6/month)

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

- Vercel handles SSL automatically
- No SSL setup needed
- Just connect domain and it works

## Summary

### SSL:
- ✅ **Vercel provides SSL** - FREE and automatic
- ✅ **No need for Bluehost SSL**
- ✅ **Just works** - No setup needed

### Email:

## Questions to Ask Bluehost

**Copy/paste these:**

1. "If I host my website on Vercel instead of Bluehost, can I still use email hosting?"

2. "Do I need active website hosting to use email accounts?"

3. "What email features are included with my domain registration?"

4. "Will my email accounts (info@risque2.com) still work if I host the website elsewhere?"

**Most likely:** They'll say yes, email is separate from website hosting.

## Bottom Line

**SSL:** ✅ Vercel handles it - FREE and automatic  
**Email:** ⚠️ Check with Bluehost, but likely still available. If not, use Zoho (free) or Google Workspace ($6/month)
