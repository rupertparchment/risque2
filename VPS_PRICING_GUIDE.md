## Negotiation Tips

**When talking to Bluehost:**

1. **Mention you already paid:**
   - "I already paid for shared hosting"
   - "Can you credit that toward VPS?"
   - "I'd like to use the hosting I purchased"

2. **Ask about promotions:**
   - "Do you have any VPS promotions?"
   - "What's your best price for VPS?"
   - "Can you match competitor pricing?"

3. **Consider annual pricing:**
   - Usually cheaper per month
   - But you're already locked in

4. **Ask about setup help:**
   - "Will you help me set up Node.js?"
   - "Do you provide setup assistance?"

## Alternative: Managed VPS

**Some hosts offer "Managed VPS":**
- They handle server management
- Easier for non-technical users
- Usually costs more
- Ask Bluehost if they offer this

## My Recommendation

**If Bluehost VPS is:**
- **Under $40/month** → Consider it (especially if they credit your shared hosting)
- **$40-60/month** → Maybe worth it if they help with setup
- **Over $60/month** → Probably better to use Vercel (free)

**Key factors:**
1. **Can they credit your shared hosting payment?**
2. **Do they help with Node.js setup?**
3. **Is cPanel included?**
4. **What's the actual monthly cost after credits?**

## Questions to Ask Bluehost

**Copy/paste these:**

1. "I need to run a Next.js application. What VPS plan do you recommend?"

2. "I already paid for shared hosting. Can you credit that toward VPS?"

3. "What's included in your VPS plans? (RAM, storage, CPU, bandwidth)"

4. "Can I install Node.js on VPS? Do you help with setup?"

5. "Do you include cPanel with VPS, or is that extra?"

6. "What's your best price for VPS, especially since I'm already a customer?"

7. "Do you offer managed VPS where you handle server setup?"

## Bottom Line

**Get the pricing first, then decide:**

- **If reasonable ($20-40/month) + they credit shared hosting** → VPS might be worth it
- **If expensive ($60+/month) or no credit** → Vercel is better value
- **If they help with setup** → VPS becomes more attractive
- **If you're technical** → VPS gives you more control

**Either way works!** Get the pricing, compare to Vercel (free), and decide what makes sense for you.
